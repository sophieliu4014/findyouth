                  At FindYouth, we believe that leadership isn't just a title—it's a mindset that grows through community, creativity, and connection. That's why we've developed the FindYouth Framework, built on 8 core "P" Pillars that guide how youth can explore impact, purpose, and growth.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  From Passion to Productivity, each pillar is paired with 10 actionable ideas—designed to help young people take initiative, lead authentically, and build real-world skills that last. Whether you're just getting started or looking for your next step, this framework is a practical launchpad for youth-led change.
